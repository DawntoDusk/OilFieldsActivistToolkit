      <p>"Shell has applied to the UK government to start developing a new North Sea gas field, called Jackdaw, off the coast of Scotland. Shell has submitted plans for the field to the regulator, OPRED, which is now deciding on whether or not to approve them. Shell is the sole owner and operator of Jackaw. If approved, Jackdaw’s output will only meet around 1- 2% of UK gas demand over its lifetime. Shell’s plans for Jackdaw have already been rejected by the regulator because of its potential impact on the climate: Jackdaw’s gas is particularly polluting because it has a naturally high CO2 content. Shell was told by the regulator in October last year to come up with a different plan, one that aligned with the UK's climate targets and the oil and gas industry’s own, albeit very weak commitments on reducing emissions. Shell has ignored the regulator’s demand and in February this year submitted essentially the same proposal with only very minor changes."</p>
