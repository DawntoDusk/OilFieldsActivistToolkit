  <p>In the United States, companies can construct and use oil drilling facilities on public and private land, and offshore waters. These companies are usually independent producers and mainly operate in the United States. The National Oil Companies (NOCs) are oil and gas companies which are mainly owned by the government. The NOCs operate as an extension of a nation's government, provide financial support, and can sometimes provide “strategic support.” These companies focus on strengthening their government’s domestic or foreign policies, “employing citizens,… generating long-term revenue to pay for government programs, and supplying inexpensive domestic energy.” NOCs are also members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. At the beginning of 2020, OPEC members “held about 71% of the world's total proved crude oil reserves, and the OPEC members in 2020 accounted for about 36% of total world crude oil production.” There are oil and gas companies referred to as major oil companies, which have thousands of their employees spread out across the world: International Oil Companies (IOCs). International Oil Companies (IOCs)—which include ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and BP—are entirely owned and controlled by investors. IOCs generally try to develop and produce oil quickly in order to sell their product on the global market.
