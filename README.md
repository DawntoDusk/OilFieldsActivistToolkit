Project by Anshu Addanki - Oil Field Awareness

Oil fields are not talked about often and have significant unknown impacts. I created this website to raise awareness about oil fields and encourage views to take action against their approval. This website was programmed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make the website interactive and visually appealing.
